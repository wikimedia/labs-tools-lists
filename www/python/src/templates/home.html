        <h1>Welcome to Lists Project homepage!</h1>

        <h2>Project's purpose</h2>
            <p>The goal of this project is to offer a list of lists, autoupdate every day or week (according to the
                importance), for Wikimedia projects. Each list is generated from the shared database, using the query
                written at the bottom of its page.</p>
            <p>Currently the tool produces lists only for Italian Wikipedia. Write us if you want some lists implemented
                also in &lt;any_language&gt; Wikipedia!</p>

        <h2>Contacts</h2>
            <p>If you want new lists or if you have any questions regarding Lists, please contact its authors in 
                <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discussioni_Wikipedia:Elenchi_generati_offline">this
                talk page</a> on Italian Wikipedia (please write only in English or Italian).</p>
