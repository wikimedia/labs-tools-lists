## Lists philosophy

Lists is a project hosted on [Wikimedia Toolforge](https://toolforge.org). Its goal is to create a place where it is possible to create, edit, analyze and run easily queries and scripts to create lists of wiki pages.

The lists can be both for human-usage and for bot-usage.

At the moment only SQL queries are supported and they are run automatically by the system with a certain frequency.
